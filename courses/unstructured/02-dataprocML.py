## main

# We could use sc.textFiles(...)
#
#   However, that will read each line of text as a separate object.
#   And using the REST API to NLP for each line will rapidly exhaust the rate-limit quota 
#   producing HTTP 429 errors
#
#   Instead, it is more efficient to pass an entire document to NLP in a single call.
#
#   So we are using sc.wholeTextFiles(...)
#
#      This provides a file as a tuple.
#      The first element is the file pathname, and second element is the content of the file.
#
