def rnn_multistation_sampling_temperature_sequencer(filenames, resample_by=1, batch_size=sys.maxsize, sequence_size=sys.maxsize, n_forward=0, nb_epochs=1, tminmax=False, keepinmem=True):
    """
    Loads temperature data from CSV files.
    Each data sequence is resampled by "resample_by". Use 1 not to resample.
    The data is also shifted by n_forward after resampling to generate target training sequences.
    n_forward is typically 1 but can be 0 to disable shifting or >1 to train to predict further in advance.
    Each data sequence is split into sequences of size sequence_size. The default is a single sequence with everything.
    Sequences are then assembled in batches of batch_size, sequences from the same weather station
    always on the same line in each batch. batch_size is infinite by default which will result in a batch
    as large as the number of available files.
    When batch_size data files are exhausted, the next batch of files is loaded.
    By default (Tmin, Tmax, interpolated) are returned if tminmax is False. Otherwise (Tmin, Tmax).
    By default, all loaded data is kept in memory and re-served from there. Set keepinmem=False to discard and reload.
    
    Returns epoch, filecount, sample, target, date
      epoch: the epoch number. RNN state should be reset on every epoch change.
      filecount: files loaded in this epoch. RNN state should be reset on every filecount change.
      sample, target: the pair of training samples and targets, of size batch_size or less
      date: sequence of dates corresponding to the samples (assumed the same across batch)
