    "## Introduction \n",
    "BigQuery is Google's fully managed, NoOps, low cost analytics database. With BigQuery you can query terabytes and terabytes of data without having any infrastructure to manage or needing a database administrator. BigQuery uses SQL and can take advantage of the pay-as-you-go model. BigQuery allows you to focus on analyzing data to find meaningful insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a publicly available ecommerce dataset that has millions of Google Analytics records for the Google Merchandise Store loaded into a table in BigQuery. In this lab, you use a copy of that dataset. Sample scenarios are provided, from which you look at the data and ways to remove duplicate information. The lab then steps you through further analysis the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "BigQuery can be accessed by its own browser-based interface, Google Data Studio, and many third party tools.  In this lab you will use the BigQuery directly in notebook cells using the iPython magic command `%%bigquery`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps you will follow in the lab are analogous to what you would do to prepare data for use in advanced ML operations. You will follow the notebook to experiment with the BigQuery queries provided to analyze the data."

    "Scenario: You were provided with Google Analytics logs for an eCommerce website in a BigQuery dataset.  The data analyst team created a new BigQuery table of all the raw eCommerce visitor session data.  This data tracks user interactions, location, device types, time on page, and details of any transaction.  Your ultimate plan is to use this data in an ML capacity to create a model that delivers highly accurate predictions of user behavior to support tailored marketing campaigns.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "BigQuery supports [two flavors](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/migrating-from-legacy-sql#comparison_of_legacy_and_standard_sql) of SQL syntax: legacy SQL and standard SQL. The preferred is standard SQL because it complies with the official SQL:2011 standard. To instruct BigQuery to interpret our syntax as such we start the query with `#standardSQL`.\n",
