    "This tutorial demonstrates how to implement **Integrated Gradients (IG)**, an explainable AI technique described in the paper [Axiomatic Attribution for Deep Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01365). IG aims to explain the relationship between a model's predictions in terms of its features. It has many use cases including understanding feature importances, identifying data skew, and debugging model performance.\n",

    "IG has become a popular interpretability technique due to its broad applicability to any differentiable model, ease of implementation, theoretical justifications, and computational efficiency relative to alternative approaches that allows it to scale to large networks and feature spaces such as images.\n",

    "You will start by walking through an implementation of IG step-by-step. Next, you will apply IG attributions to understand the pixel feature importances of an image classifier and explore applied machine learning use cases. Lastly, you will conclude with discussion of IG's properties, limitations, and suggestions for next steps in your learning journey.\n",

The basic intuition is to measure a feature's importance to your model by incrementally increasing a feature's intensity between its absense (baseline) and its input value, compute the change between your model's predictions with respect to the original feature at each step, and average these incremental changes together. To gain a deeper understanding for how IG works, you will walk through its application over the sub-sections below."

    "Defining missingness or a starting point in feature spaces for comparison is at the core of machine learning interpretability methods. For IG, this concept is encoded as a baseline. A **baseline** is an uniformative input used as a starting point for defining IG attributions in relation to and essential for interpreting IG prediction attributions as a function of individual input features.\n",

Models with structured data that typically involve a mix of continuous numeric features will typically use the observed median value as a baseline because 0 is an informative value for these features. Note, however, that this changes the interpretation of the features to their importance in relation to the baseline value as opposed to the input data directly.

Why bother with slowly changing the intensity of the input image at all? The reason why is networks can *saturate*, meaning the magnitude of the local feature gradients can become extremely small and go toward zero resulting in important features having a small gradient. *The implication is that saturation can result in discontinuous feature importances and miss important features.*\n",

    "To summarize, IG is a popular Explainable AI method because of its broad applicability to any differentiable model, ease of implementation as this tutorial demonstrated, and relative computational efficiency compared to alternative explainability approaches that allows it to scale to large networks and feature spaces (e.g. images).\n",
    "\n",
    "Explainable AI techniques are challenging to empirically evaluate and compare against each other. A secondary contribution of the original IG paper was to establish several axioms to evaluate explainability approaches and guide their own development of IG. Below are the axioms related to this tutorial and restated for clarity:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Completeness**: the sum of IG attributions of all features is equal to the difference in your model's output for its input features and your model's output for the basline. The implications of this property are that you have a theoretical basis to determine how well IG's integral approximation converged and how you should adjust the number of steps hyperparameter. This was discussed previously in the tutorial in section *Step 4: Checks to pick number of steps for IG approximation* of this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Sensitivity**: all input features that differ between the input and baseline and result in different predictions will a non-zero attribution by IG. Conversely, any feature that does not impact the model's function will not receive any attribution. The practical implication of sensitivity is that you can count on IG to identify all feature importances and be more resistant to spurious attributions compared to just gradients. The key is in proper selection of the baseline as discussed in sections *Step 2: Establish baseline to compare inputs against* and *How do different baselines impact interpretation of IG attributions?*\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Implementation Invariance**: IG attributions will be the same for functionally equivalent models that output the same value for any given input. This is important to note in practice when interpretting and communicating results, because models with vastly different architectures and hyperparameters, can have identical IG attributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Linearity**: Gradients are a natural analog to coefficients in linear models. IG attributions preserve linear relationships in the model. This includes linear combinations of different models; for these combined ensembled models, attributions represented the weighted sum between the individual model's attributions.\n",

    "\n",
    "*   **IG provides local, not global interpretability**: IG provides a theoretically sound understanding of feature importances on individual examples. However, it does not provide a relative global feature importance for understanding overall model performance across data sets. For image data, there is no clear way to aggregate feature attributions of individual image pixels for global model interpretability. Individual pixels by themselves carry little meaning; its through their combination with other pixels into higher order features (e.g. edges, shapes) that you can determine meaning. For structured numeric and text data, you can apply statistical aggregations (e.g. mean) across the absolute value of IG attributions to various sets of examples to get a sense of a model's global feature importances relative to selected baselines. Although it is importance to keep in mind interpretation of these results can be potentially misleading and sensitive to feature baseline selection and relationships between features.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **IG explains network predictions in relation to individual features, not feature interactions and combinations**: Deep Neural Networks are powerful universal function approximators due to flexible function fitting capabilities that non-linearities (e.g. activation functions) introduce. However, IG is doing a first-order linear approximation of the functional relationship between model outputs and individual input features so you still do not know how the individual features interact, which are correlated, and how the network combines features to make its prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **IG can only be applied to differentiable ML models**: IG can be applied to any differentiable models such as neural networks. However, this method cannot be applied to other types of ML models without modification such as tree-based models or model ensembles that involve non-differentiable parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Limitations of baseline selection and visual inspection**: As this tutorial highlighted, proper interpretation of IG feature attributions depends upon selection of a good baseline. A black image is a great choice in most scenarios to limit interpretation of the prediction to the input features without any artifacts from the baseline but is limited when pixels important to the prediction are black themselves. As a result, visual inspection of the IG prediction attributions does not by itself always highlight all pixels of importance and may require trying out a few different baselines and contrastive explanations to fully understand the model's learned representation.\n",
