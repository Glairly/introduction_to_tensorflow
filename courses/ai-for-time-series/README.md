  * Univariate vs multivariate time series

Lab 2: [Building a Custom Time Series Forecasting Model](notebooks/02-model.ipynb)
* Tools: Vertex AI Workbench, TensorFlow
* Topics:
  * Long Short Term Networks (LSTM)
  * Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
  * Statistical modeling approaches (ARIMA, Exponential smoothing)
  * Handling missing values

Lab 3: [Training and Predicting with a Cloud Model](notebooks/03-cloud-training.ipynb)
* Tools: Vertex AI Workbench, Vertex AI Training, Vertex AI Prediction
* Topics:
  * Prepare data and models for training in the cloud
