Demo: Creating an authorized View in BigQuery

based off of: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/share-access-views

1. Open BigQuery: https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery

2. Create a dataset titled ecommerce (if not done already)

Scenario: Your anti-fraud team has asked you to create a report that lists the 10 most recent transactions that have an order amount of 1,000 or more for them to review manually.

Task: Create a new view that returns all the most recent 10 transactions with revenue greater than 1,000 on or after January 1st, 2017.

3. Copy and Paste the below query

__Scenario:__ Your data team lead has asked you to come up with a way to limit who in your organization can see the data returned by the view you just created. Order information is especially sensitive and needs to be shared only with users that have a need to see such information.

__Task:__ Modify the view you created earlier to only allow logged in users with a qwiklabs.net session domain to be able to see the data in the underlying view. (Note: You will be creating specific user group whitelists in a later lab on access; for now you are validating based on the session user's domain).

To view your own session login information, run the below query that uses SESSION_USER():
