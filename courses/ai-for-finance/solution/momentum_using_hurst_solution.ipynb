    "We're providing you with a bare-bones version that shows you how to use 30 day momentum to trade on Apple, sometime between 2015 and 2017. This naive strategy loses money and that's to be expected. Your goal is to make use of Hurst exponent that you learnt in previous lessons to create a better strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is an analytical method of momentum trading, but it is also to turn this into a machine learning problem. This is discussed at the end of the notebook, with a link to an extension exercise on the quant-quest website from Auquan for you to attempt this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goals**:\n",
    "1. Understand how the barebones momentum version is working and make yourself comfortable with it\n",
