    "\n",
    "Like DQNs, this discounted value is the label the critic will train on. While that is happening, we can subtract V(s) and the discounted value of the new state to get the advantage, or A(s,a). In human terms, how much value was the action the agent took? This is what the actor, or the policy gradient portion or our network, will train on.\n",
