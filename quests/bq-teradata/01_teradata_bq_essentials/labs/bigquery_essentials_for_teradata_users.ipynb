    "\n",
    "Inside of the BigQuery service are lots of virtual machines that massively process your data and query logic in parallel. These workers, or \"slots\", work together to process a single query job really quickly. For accounts with on-demand pricing, you can have up to 2,000 slots.\n",
    "\n",
    "So say we had 30 minutes of slot time or 1800 seconds. If the query took 20 seconds in total to run, \n",
    "but it was 1800 seconds worth of work, how many workers at minimum worked on it? \n",
    "1800/20 = 90\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's assuming each worker instantly had all the data it needed (no shuffling of data between workers) and was at full capacity for all 20 seconds!\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, workers have a variety of tasks (waiting for data, reading it, performing computations, and writing data)\n",
    "and also need to compare notes with each other on what work was already done on the job. The good news for you is\n",
    "that you don't need to worry about optimizing these workers or the underlying data to run perfectly in parallel. That's why BigQuery is a managed service -- there's an entire team dedicated to hardware and data storage optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"avg_slots\" metric indicates the average number of slots being utilized by your query at any given time. Often, portions of the query plan will have different amounts of parallelism and thus can benefit (or not) from more slots. For example, if you're performing a basic READ+FILTER+AGGREGATE query, reading data from a large table may require 1,000 slots for the `INPUT` phase since each slot reads a file, but if a lot of the data is immediately filtered, there may be fewer slots or even one slot needed for the next stage to aggregate. Certain portions of your queries may become bottlenecks for parallelism, for example, `JOIN`s, `SORT`s, etc. BigQuery can execute many of these in a parallel manner and optimizing this queries is a more advanced topic. At this point, it's important to know slot_time, and conceptually what a slot is.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you were wondering, the worker limit for your project is 2,000 slots at once. In a production setting, this will vary depending on whether your organization is using \"flat-rate\" pricing on \"on-demand\". If you're \"flat-rate\", the amount of slots will depend on the organization's reservation, how that reservations is apportioned to different folders, projects, and teams, and how busy each slice of the reservation is at any given moment."
