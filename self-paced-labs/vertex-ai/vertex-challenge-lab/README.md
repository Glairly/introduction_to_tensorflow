# Building Machine Learning solutions with Vertex AI: Challenge Lab

## Learning objectives

* Train a TensorFlow model locally in a hosted [**Vertex Notebook**](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/general/notebooks?hl=sv).
* Containerize your training code with [**Cloud Build**](https://cloud.google.com/build) and push it to [**Google Cloud Artifact Registry**](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry) as part of a Vertex custom container training workflow.
* Trigger a `CustomContainerTrainingJob` to train your model with the [**Vertex AI Python SDK**](https://googleapis.dev/python/aiplatform/latest/aiplatform.html).
* Define a pipeline using the [**Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP) V2 SDK**](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/sdk/v2/v2-compatibility) to train and deploy your model on [**Vertex Pipelines**](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/pipelines).
* Query your model on a [**Vertex Endpoint**](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/getting-predictions) using online predictions.
