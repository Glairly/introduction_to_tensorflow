Run the following command to restore dependencies to `vendor/` directory:

    dep ensure --vendor-only

## Dynamic catalog reloading / artificial delay

This service has a "dynamic catalog reloading" feature that is purposefully
not well implemented. The goal of this feature is to allow you to modify the
`products.json` file and have the changes be picked up without having to
restart the service.

However, this feature is bugged: the catalog is actually reloaded on each
request, introducing a noticeable delay in the frontend. This delay will also
show up in profiling tools: the `parseCatalog` function will take more than 80%
of the CPU time.

You can trigger this feature (and the delay) by sending a `USR1` signal and
remove it (if needed) by sending a `USR2` signal:

```
# Trigger bug
kubectl exec \
    $(kubectl get pods -l app=productcatalogservice -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
    -c server -- kill -USR1 1
# Remove bug
kubectl exec \
    $(kubectl get pods -l app=productcatalogservice -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
    -c server -- kill -USR2 1
```
